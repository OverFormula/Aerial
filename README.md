### Generate summary

to generate the summary, the config ../config/config.json is used

```python3 summary/summarizer.py```

what can be done if errors occur:

```export PYTHONPATH=.```

if you want to use a different config for development, you can create a file '../config/config_dev.json' and redefine the environment variable

```export DEV=development```

(or add it to environment variables in ide configuration)
